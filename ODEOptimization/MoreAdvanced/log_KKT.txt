Figured out why I had the correct solution, but could not build the underlying vector correctly

alphaROM is from solving the inverse problem
Run for nx = 25, nSteps = 25, and tol = 0.999
||alphaROM - alphaOPT||_2 = 0.000232477
runtime = 0.048729

||alphaROM - alphaOPT||_2 = 0.000147275

Note: the change in comparison methods makes the code take much longer
