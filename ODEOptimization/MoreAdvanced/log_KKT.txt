Note: the change in comparison methods makes the code take much longer
Run for nx = 25, nSteps = 25, and tol = 0.999
||alphaExact - alphaOPT||_2 = 0.000324726
runtime = 1.45022

Run for nx = 50, nSteps = 50, and tol = 0.999
||alphaExact - alphaOPT||_2 = 0.000148914
runtime = 8.1038

Run for nx = 100, nSteps = 100, and tol = 0.999

KL made a mistake when he suggested the values for the design and regularization constants. The new values are eta_design = 10.0 and eta_reg = 0.001
